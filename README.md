# hello-world
My very first repository

Good day, world.  I'm Don Wolford, an IT professional who's been around a while.

I started out as a developer back when assembler was a thing.
Since about 1998, I've been focused almost entirely on the database world,
and I let my development skills stagnate.
So now I am catching up with the brave new world of 21st century development.
And this repository, and using to use the whole set of tools, is part of that process.

Cheer me on!
